# Food Delivery Website - FoodDX

I created a fully responsive food delivery website from viewing a UX/UI design online. This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design

# Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer. The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me.
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page.
* Creating a website ASAP.
* Grid and Flexbox

# Challenges

* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Making each section of the page have the height and width of the ui/ux mockup.
* Mobile UI/UX design
